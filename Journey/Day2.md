# ☝️Day 2 into web development 

Phew😣, today was kind of a long day. Diving into CSS was not easy. There was so much information to swallow but I think once you get the thing, it starts to be more understandable. Let's review this day

## 🤔 What we learnt

   - 📒 A bit of history about CSS
   - 📙 Ways to use CSS in our HTML file
   - 📘 Elements hierarchy: It's not for nothing CSS means Cascading StyleSheet. Understand how a modification on a parent can affect his children can be pretty tricky.
   - 📗 Centering divs 😭😭
   - 📓 Learnt the difference between position: absolute; and position: relative;. I thought my brain was turning aside while trying to understand this.
   - 📒 Learnt how to create a form
   - 📙 Learnt about some basic inputs.

## 😖🤕 Struggles

There are some issues bothering me 
   - ❔ Is it normal to have tons of divs ??
   - ❓ When should I use <section> instead of <div>
   - ❔ How can I check that my website works on every device

## 🌟💫 Results 

I made a simple connexion page, I don't know JavaScript yet so it's not interactive.
If you want the code, just ask in the comments.
