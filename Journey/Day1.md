# ☝️ Day 1 into Web Development 
 That was my first day learning web development, I'm actually following an Open classroom guide for HTML5 and CSS3. I actually got through the HTML part.
I also readed the IBM's article about best practices with HTML5. Always good to know

## 🌟✨What have I learnt?

   - 📓What is HTML and a little bit of history 
   - 📗How to make a basic HTML file
   - 📘Some basic tags (p, br, a, etc)
   - 📙Learnt about attributes and links
   - 📒Some best practices for HTML5 

## 💫Results

Actually started my portfolio, still kind of empty but I won't spoil everything about myself when the journey just begun 🤗
