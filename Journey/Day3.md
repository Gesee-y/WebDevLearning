# ☝️ Day 3 into web development 

Wow, today was kind of hard🤧. I was really busy in the morning, so I just hard the evening to work. Something like 6h to understand the CSS box model, I thought I wouldn't make it but here we are😁.
Also, since I don't have a computer, I code on my phone so there might be so weird things (but the app I use can simulate other type of screen, so it's fine if it works on most of the resolution)

## 🤔❓ What we learnt

   - 📙 Some ways to position elements in a website 
   - 📓 What is the attribute display and how to take advantage of it
   - 📒 How a well structured HTML site can make it well suited for web research as Google said it
   - 📗 How to use a flexbox (confused me a bit at the start)
   - 📘 How to use inline-blocks
   - 📙 How to make a web page more responsive

## 😅😣 Tips

If someone is willing to talk about how he structure his pages or have some suggestions on how to use flexbox, I'm all ears.

## 🌟💫 Results 

I made a little blog about one of my favorite game named Undertale. The purpose of this site was just to understand how to place contents in the web page so the design might not be the best😅.
